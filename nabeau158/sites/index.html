        <p id="lyrics">Payback is a bad bitch</br>
        And baby, I'm the baddest</br>
        
        Now I'm out here looking like revenge</br>
        Feelin like a 10, the best I ever been</br>
        And yeah, I know how bad it must hurt</br>
        To see me like this but it gets worse (wait a minute)</br>
        Now you're out here looking like regret</br>
        Ain't too proud to beg</br>
        second chance you'll never get</br>
        And yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this</br>
        But it gets worse (wait a minute)</br>
        </br>
        Now payback is a bad bitch</br>
        And baby, I'm the baddest</br>
        You fuckin' with a savage</br>
        Can't have this, can't have this</br>
        And it'd be nice for me to take it easy on ya, but nah</br>
</br>
        Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)</br>
        Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)</br>
        Being so bad got me feeling so good</br>
        Showing you up like I know that I would</br>
        Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)</br>
        Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)</br>
        Feeling inspired 'cause the tables have turned</br>
        Yeah, I'm on fire and I know that it burns</br>
</br>
        Baby, fineness is the way to kill</br>
        Tell me how it feel, bet it's such a bitter pill</br>
        And yeah, I know you thought you had bigger, better things</br>
        Bet right now this stings (wait a minute)</br>
        Cause the grass is greener under me</br>
        Bright as technicolor, I can tell that you can see</br>
        And yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this</br>
        But it gets worse (wait a minute)</br>
</br>
        Now payback is a bad bitch</br>
        And baby, I'm the baddest</br>
